# 4State_HealthCare_Utilization_Analysis

As a multicultural, first-generation American and public health researcher, I have always been passionate about understanding and addressing health inequities. This project focuses on analyzing healthcare utilization patterns and identifying areas for improvement, with a particular focus on racial and health equity indicators. 

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of healthcare utilization across four states, namely Massachusetts (MA), California (CA), Alaska (AK), and Hawaii (HI). By examining healthcare utilization rates, disparities, and factors influencing healthcare utilization, we aim to gain insights that can inform strategies and interventions to improve healthcare equity.

## Project Breakdown

### Identify and gather relevant healthcare utilization datasets for each state:
  - MA: [Massachusetts Health Data Consortium](https://www.masshealthdata.org/)
  - CA: [California Health and Human Services Agency](https://www.chhs.ca.gov/)
  - AK: [Alaska Department of Health and Social Services](https://dhss.alaska.gov/Pages/default.aspx)
  - HI: [Hawaii State Department of Health](https://health.hawaii.gov/)

### Preprocess the data:
  - Clean the datasets by handling missing values and inconsistencies.

### Conduct descriptive statistics:
  - Calculate healthcare utilization rates, expenditure distributions, and disparities across different racial and ethnic groups within each state.

### Visualize the data:
  - Create bar charts, histograms, and maps to visually represent healthcare utilization patterns, disparities, and geographical variations.

### Perform regression analysis:
  - Investigate the impact of race and other socio-economic factors on healthcare utilization rates, controlling for confounding variables.

### Analyze and summarize key findings:
  - Identify major insights gained from the analysis, focusing on racial and health equity indicators.

### Develop recommendations:
  - Based on the analysis findings, suggest potential strategies or interventions to improve healthcare equity.
